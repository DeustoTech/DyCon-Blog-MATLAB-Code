
%% Model Problem
% We consider the numerical approximation of the inverse problem for the linear advection-diffusion equation,
%%
% $$
% \begin{equation}\label{modeleq}
% \begin{cases}
% \partial_t u - d \Delta u + v \nabla \cdot u = 0, \  \  \textbf{x}  \in \Omega, t \in [0,T],\\
% u(\textbf{x},t) = 0,  \  \  \textbf{x}  \in \partial \Omega, t \in [0,T],\\
% u(\textbf{x},0) = u_0(\textbf{x}), \  \  \textbf{x}  \in \Omega,\\ 
% \end{cases}
% \end{equation}
% $$
%%
% with $d$ being the diffusivity of the material and $v$ the direction of the advection. 
%%
% Given a final time $T>0$ and a target function $u^\ast$ 
% the aim is to identify the initial condition $u_0$ such
% that the solution, at time $t=T$, reaches the target $u^*$ or gets as close as possible to it. We assume that the initial condition $u_0$ is characterized as a combined set of sparse sources. This means that $u_0$ is a linear combination of unitary deltas with certain and possibly different weights, i.e:
% 
%% 
% $$
% \begin{align}
% u_0 = \sum_{i=1}^{l} \alpha_i \delta(x_i). 
% \end{align} $$
%%
% We formulate the inverse problem using optimal control techniques. In particular, we consider the minimization of the following functional: 
%%
% $$
% \begin{align}
% J(u_0) := J(u(\cdot,0)) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\Omega} (u(\cdot, T) - u^*)^2 d \Omega + \tau \int_{\Omega} | u(\cdot,0) | d \Omega.
% \end{align}
% $$
%% Space and time discretization
% Letting $\textbf{u} : [0, T] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^s$ where $s$ is the number of grid points on 
% $\Omega$, we can write a general finite element (FE) discretization of the diffusion--advection 
% equation in \eqref{modeleq} in a compact form as:
%%
% $$
% \begin{align}
% \textbf{M} \dot{\textbf{u}}(t) + d \textbf{A} \textbf{u}(t) + v \textbf{V} \textbf{u}(t) = 0.
% \end{align}
% $$
%%
% In order to get a time discretized version of the previous equation, we apply implicit Euler method with stepsize $\Delta t := T/N$ where $N$ is the total number of time steps. The numerical approximations to the solution are given by the vectors $\textbf{u}^n \approx \textbf{u}(t_n) \in \mathbb{R}^s$ with respect to the index $n=i\Delta t$ for $i=1,2,..,N$. Therefore, the fully discrete version of model equation is as follows,
%% 
% $$
% \begin{align}
% (\textbf{M} + d \Delta t \textbf{A} + v \Delta t \textbf{V}) \textbf{u}^{n+1} = \textbf{M} \textbf{u}^n. 
% \end{align}
% $$
%% Adjoint Algorithm for sparse source identification
% The algorithm to be presented in this work for the sparse source identification 
% of the linear diffusion-advection equation based on the adjoint methodology consists of two steps. 
% Firstly, we use the adjoint methodology to identify the locations of the sources. Secondly, a least 
% squares fitting is applied to find the corresponding intensities of the sources.
%%
% We have considered here a two-dimensional example with several
% sources to be identified in a multi-model environment. This means that the left half ($\Omega_1 = [0,1] \times [0,1]$) and 
% the right half ($\Omega_2 = [1,2] \times [0,1]$) of the domain are modelled with different equations. 
% In particular, the heat equation is used on $\Omega_1$ and the diffusion--advection equation is used on $\Omega_2$.
%%
% The initialization parameters look as follows:
N=30; % space discretization points in y-direction
dx=1/(N+1); % mesh size
t0=0; % initial time
tf=0.1; % final time
n=5; % time discretization points
dt=(tf-t0)/n; % stepsize
TOL=1e-5; % stopping tolerance

d1=0.05; % diffusivity of the material on the left sudomain
d2=0.05; % diffusivity of the material on the left sudomain

% advection components
vx=0;
vy=-3;

tau=dx^4; % regularization parameter
epsilon=0.1; % stepsize of the gradient descent method
%%
% We now compute the FE discretization matrices $M$, $A$ and $V$ that are
% respectively the mass matrix, the stiffness matrix and the advection
% matrix. For the FE discretization we assume equidistant structured
% meshes. In particular we use triangular elements and the classical pyramidal test
% functions are employed. 
%%
[M,A,V] = computeFEmatrices(N,d1,d2,vx,vy); % Compute FE discretization matrices
%%
% A reference initial condition is chosen and we compute using the FE
% discretization specified above and implicit Euler in time its
% corresponding final state at time $T$. This final state will be considered the
% initial data of the inverse problem to be solved and we name it the target function $u^*$ as mentioned previously. 
%%
U0_ref = initial_deltas(N); % computes reference initial condition

[U_target,u_target] = compute_target(U0_ref,N,n,dt,M,A,V); % Compute target distribution
%%
% We now call the algorithm that estimates the initial condition $u_0$
% using as a initial data the target function $u^*$. As mentioned before,
% this algorithm consists of two steps. 
%%
% Firstly, the classical adjoint
% methodology that minimizes the functional $J(u_0)$ subject to the
% diffusion-advection equation is used. The iterative optimization algorithm employed
% is the classical gradient descent method. However, although this iterative
% procedure finds quite accurately the locations of the sources, it does not recover the sparse character of the initial condition.
% This is not suprising because the recovered initial data comes from
% solving the adjoint problem which is basically a diffusive process that
% smoothes out its state. Consequently, a second procedure is needed to
% project the obtained non sparse initial condition into the set of
% admissible sparse solutions. 
%%
% As the initial condition $u_0$ is assumed to be a linear combination
% between the locations and the intensities, once we have fixed the
% locations using the adjoint methodology we can solve a least squares
% problem to get the remaining intensities. We assemble a matrix $\textbf{L} \in \mathbb{R}^{s \times l}$ 
% where at each column we have the forward solution for a single unitary
% delta placed at each of the locations already identified. 
% We then solve the following linear system of equations for the vector of unknowns $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \alpha_2, ..., \alpha_l)^T$: 
%%
% $$
% \begin{align}
% \textbf{L}^T \textbf{L} \alpha = \textbf{L}^T u^*,
% \end{align} $$
%%
% to find the intensities vector $\alpha$. 
%%
% Adjoint algorithm for sparse source identification (algorithm 4)
U0 = SparseIdentification(u_target,TOL,dt,n,N,M,A,V,epsilon,tau); 
%%
% Finally, the final state at $T$ is computed using as a initial condition
% the estimated sparse sources identified with our algorithm. 
%%
% Compute final state with the recovered initial condition
[UF,u_final,U_all] = compute_target(U0,N,n,dt,M,A,V); 
%%
% We now visualize the numerical results. Plots on the left side show the
% reference initial solution and the given target. Similarly, plots on the
% right side show the recovered initial condition and the distribution at
% the final time $T$ produced by the recovered initial sources. 
%%
% One can observe the difference between the two models (the heat equation on $\Omega_1$ and the diffusion-advection on $\Omega_2$)
% in the two figures at the bottom where the initial sources on $\Omega_2$ move downwards at the same time as they dissipate while the
% initial sources on $\Omega_1$ only dissipate without displacement.
